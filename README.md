# MovieCertifications
### Scrape data on movie certifications from CBFC site

#### Step1: 
Download the repo into your system, into a folder of your choice.

#### Step2: 
Open the movies.csv on a text editor/excel as you wish.  It contains a huge list of 5L+ movies.  Each row contains two pieces of information - the movie id and lang_id, as used by the [CBFC site](https://www.cbfcindia.gov.in/main/)

Decide which movies you want to scrape - the **_from_** and **_to_** indices.

#### Step3: 
Open the MovieCertifications.ipynb and run all the cells.

When it prompts you, enter the **_from_** index, hit Enter and then enter the **_to_** index.

The notebook will continue to run.  

If you scroll down (while it runs), you'll see a running list of movie information that're getting downloaded.

Once it finishes downloading, it'll automatically export the data to a csv file in the same folder you downloaded the code files.  This csv contains the information about all movies you scraped.

#### Step4:

CSV files thus generated by all could be pooled into a common location (TBD) and merged to get the final list of 5L+ movies.
